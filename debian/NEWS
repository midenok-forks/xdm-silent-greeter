xdm (1:1.1.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version has XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 cookies disabled. While this
  fixes a couple of problems, there is a problem with left over cookies
  in users' .Xauthority files.
  Usually XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 cookies from users' .Xauthority files
  are removed when logging out. If they are still there when installing
  this version, then this user will not be able to log in again until
  removing those cookies from .Xauthority using xauth(1) or deleting the
  whole .Xauthority file. (Do not do this while logged in. No application
  will be able to connect to the X server after that.)

xdm (1:1.1.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  As many other display managers, xdm does not pass -dpi 100 to the
  X server anymore. xserver-xorg-core now uses 96 instead of 75 by
  default, it should be fine for most people.
  In case of problem, the DisplaySize option be used in the Monitor
  section of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to force another DPI. If you
  have multiple RandR 1.2 outputs, DisplaySize should be specified
  in each Monitor section.
